# Optical-Flow-Analysis-Lucas-Kanade-and-Farneback

This project showcases the implementation and comparison of two major optical flow algorithms: Lucas-Kanade and Farneback. It includes practical applications such as:

- Motion Analysis: Tracking points of interest and visualizing global motion in video sequences.
- Scene Change Detection: Using Lucas-Kanade to identify keyframes in videos with significant movement changes.
- Visualization: Annotated outputs highlighting trajectories (Lucas-Kanade) or dense motion fields (Farneback).


The repository contains code, parameter explanations, and results obtained from real-world video examples. Ideal for understanding optical flow in computer vision and its applications in video processing.
